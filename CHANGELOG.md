## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`GovernorLoop(decompose=True, bind_fn=…)` — the decompose→bind pipeline as the loop's live
  authoring path (opt-in, default off).** Makes `decompose → staff → assemble` the actual runtime
  behavior of `GovernorLoop.run()`, not just a library call: round-1 authors a multi-node CAPABILITY
  DAG (`plan_from_goal(decompose=True)`) and staffs it via `staff_capability_dag()` into an
  assemblable manifest set (bind each capability to a standing agent via `bind_fn`, else author a
  low-trust skeleton) — replacing the manifest-as-plan reconcile. The staffed set is computed once
  and memoized so `assemble`/`recompile` and every episode supervisor share ONE deterministic set,
  and a resume re-derives it identically (INV-4). Runs cold-start with ZERO caller manifests. Pure/
  offline authoring (INV-2); the emitted DAG is still frozen by `assemble` (INV-3). Composes with the
  Phase-6 contract gates (`strict_types`/`single_writer`/`check_acceptance` + the trust dial). Default
  `decompose=False` keeps round-1 authoring byte-for-byte the single-shot `plan_from_goal` path over
  the caller's manifests. +4 tests. **This completes the integration half — the decompose→bind→align
  pipeline the FZ 35e2b critique called for now runs end-to-end through the governor loop.**

- **`governor.authoring.staff_capability_dag()` — staff a capability DAG into an assemblable
  manifest set (the decompose→bind→relabel front).** Closes the hard middle that made a decomposed
  plan un-runnable: a capability `AgentDAG` (from `plan_from_goal(..., decompose=True)`) has
  agent-agnostic task nodes + edges but no manifests and no `depends_on` wiring, so `assemble` (which
  requires a manifest per node and derives wiring from `depends_on`) could not freeze it. This
  synthesizes, per node, a manifest keyed by the node id — bound to a standing agent via `bind_fn`
  (the scheduler's job) or authored as a skeleton (`author_manifest`, the Create arrow for an
  UNMATCHED capability) — plus its data-wiring from the DAG edges (one input per upstream producer,
  fed by `<producer>.result`). The result is `{node: AgentManifest}` ready for
  `OrchestrationAssembler.assemble(dag, …)`. **This makes the cold-start path work end-to-end** —
  `decompose → staff → assemble` freezes a real multi-node plan with ZERO hand-authored manifests
  (the plan's north-star). Pure + offline (INV-2); binds/authors VALUES, never dispatches, never
  mutates a running plan. `bind_fn=None` (default) authors every node (zero-bench cold start). +4
  tests. (Wiring it as the governor loop's *default* authoring path — retiring
  `_reconcile_dag_with_manifests` — is a separate, larger loop change; this is the reusable core it
  will call.)

- **`make_trust_strictness()` + `strict_fn=` / `acceptance_fn=` — adaptive strictness dial (opt-in,
  default off).** The capstone of the Phase-6 compiler contract: turns the three global contract
  gates (B1 single-writer, B2 type-align, B3 output-QA) into a *per-agent* dial keyed on the Trust
  Ladder. `governor.make_trust_strictness(scheduler, strict_below=L2_GUARDED)` returns a
  `node -> bool` predicate that is `True` for a WEAK/below-bar agent (gets the strict contract) and
  `False` for a STRONG/proven one (runs lean); an unknown/unproven node is treated as weak
  (conservative strict). Wire it as `OrchestrationAssembler(..., strict_fn=…)` (dials B1/B2) and/or
  `Supervisor(..., acceptance_fn=…)` (dials B3). Default (`strict_fn=None`/`acceptance_fn=None`)
  applies an enabled gate to every node — byte-for-byte the un-dialed behavior. Realizes "contract
  strictness ∝ 1/strength, read off the same ladder that governs autonomy"; author/compile-time
  only (INV-2). +5 tests. **Phase-6 compiler contract complete (B1+B2+B3+B4).**

- **`Supervisor(check_acceptance=True)` + `check_acceptance()` — output-QA acceptance contract
  (opt-in, default off).** A post-run gate DEEPER than the required-key presence check: after a
  successful shape-validate, each output field's *value* is checked against a declared per-field
  ``acceptance`` contract (``non_empty`` / ``min_length`` / ``max_length`` / ``enum`` / ``pattern`` —
  declarative + deterministic, no code eval). A present-but-wrong output fails here exactly like a
  schema failure, so it is NOT admitted to the store and does NOT complete — the machine-checkable
  "good output" signal the Trust Ladder needs (a failed QA never earns trust). It rides the existing
  retry/record path (raises under ``on_error='raise'``, records-failed under ``'record'``), never
  mutates a frozen plan (INV-3), and adds no compiler loop (INV-2). Conservative: a field with no
  ``acceptance`` mapping is unconstrained, so a manifest that declares none is unaffected. Default
  ``check_acceptance=False`` keeps the run byte-for-byte unchanged. FZ 35e2b3b Phase-6 compiler
  contract (#3 output-QA). +5 tests.

- **`OrchestrationAssembler(single_writer=True)` / `check_alignment(..., single_writer=True)` —
  non-overlap / single-writer gate (opt-in, default off).** Rejects a plan where any consumer input
  is fed by more than one `depends_on` edge. Two edges targeting the same `input_name` are a
  single-writer violation: at run time the supervisor overlays `payload[input_name] = …` per edge, so
  a second writer would silently last-wins (a non-deterministic data-flow bug) — this catches it at
  compile time (`AlignmentError`). Composable with `strict_types`; compile-time only (INV-2). Default
  `single_writer=False` keeps behavior byte-for-byte unchanged. FZ 35e2b3b Phase-6 compiler contract
  (#1 non-overlap). +4 tests.

- **`OrchestrationAssembler(strict_types=True)` / `check_alignment(..., strict_types=True)` — deep
  type-alignment gate (opt-in, default off).** Upgrades the compiler's edge check from field-*name*
  presence to *type compatibility*: for each `depends_on` edge, the producer output field's declared
  JSON-Schema `type` must be compatible with the consumer input's declared `type`, or
  `AlignmentError` is raised. It is **conservative** — an unknown/absent type on either side passes
  (the gate can only *prove* a mismatch, never guess one), so turning it on never rejects a manifest
  that omits type annotations — and it supports JSON-Schema union types (`["string", "null"]`),
  passing when the producer type overlaps the consumer's accepted set. Compile-time only (no runtime
  effect, INV-2 preserved); routes through `assemble`/`recompile`. Default `strict_types=False` keeps
  the name-level gate byte-for-byte unchanged. First slice of the FZ 35e2b3b Phase-6 compiler
  contract (deepen #2). +6 tests.

- **`GovernorLoop(record_frontier=True)` — wire the scheduler→compiler channel onto the live path
  (opt-in, default off).** Closes the previously-dead `compile_next` channel *in the loop* (the
  mechanism shipped in 0.4.3; this connects it): when a `TrustLadderScheduler` is set and
  `record_frontier=True`, the router's cleared frontier (`FrontierProposal.compile_next` — the nodes
  trust-cleared to dispatch this round) is threaded into the next round's `recompile(compile_next=…)`
  and recorded on the fresh frozen plan's read-only `ProvisioningPlan.frontier` field. It is a pure
  provenance annotation: `assemble`/`recompile` filter it to topology nodes and never let it change
  `order`/`entries`/`wiring` (the monotonic superset is preserved), and `frontier` is emitted in
  `to_dict()` only when non-empty. Default `record_frontier=False` keeps the loop byte-for-byte
  unchanged (recompile is called without `compile_next`). +2 tests.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- **Pipeline gap-fill: planner-decompose → scheduler-bind → create → align → transfer (all opt-in).**
  A set of additive, default-off capabilities that un-collapse *binding* from *authoring* so a goal
  can be launched by instantiating the capacity it needs (design the roles, staff them — creating
  new ones where the bench has no fit — align the staffed team, and transfer prior experience across
  domains), while the compiler/freeze/replay identity is preserved. Every item defaults OFF, so the
  shipped behavior is byte-for-byte unchanged:
  - **Planner capability decomposer** — `plan_from_goal(..., decompose=True)` emits a deterministic,
    offline multi-node **capability** DAG (agent-agnostic task labels, keyword-routed shapes with a
    generic `ingest → analyze → synthesize → format` fallback) instead of the single-node fallback,
    subject to a per-sub-task complexity contract (`max_nodes`/`max_depth`/`max_fanout`, author-time,
    raising `PlanAuthorError`). An injected `plan_model_fn` still overrides the template. Default
    `decompose=False` keeps the single-node fallback.
  - **Scheduler as a binder** — a new `Binding` value plus `TrustLadderScheduler.decide_ranked()` /
    `propose_bindings()` select an agent from the **full candidate set** (`registry.match_all`) by
    **trust priority** (best-trust-first), with an optional `load_fn` availability tie-break — a
    genuine task→agent binding, not just the first-match trust *gate* (`decide`/`propose_frontier`
    are untouched).
  - **`recompile(compile_next=…)` — closes the dead scheduler→compiler channel** by recording the
    scheduler's cleared frontier on a new read-only `ProvisioningPlan.frontier` field. It never
    changes `order`/`entries`/`wiring` (the monotonic superset is preserved); `frontier` is emitted
    in `to_dict()` only when non-empty, so the default is byte-for-byte unchanged.
  - **Net-new agent-manifest authoring** — a new `concursus.governor.authoring.author_manifest()`
    authors a valid `AgentManifest` for a capability that has no matching manifest (a deterministic
    low-trust skeleton by default, or an injected `manifest_author_fn` LLM seam), so a net-new role
    can be *created*, not just provisioned from a declared manifest. A freshly authored agent enters
    at `L0_SHADOW` and must earn autonomy.
  - **Auto-Create on `UNMATCHED`** — `GovernorLoop(auto_create=True, create_fn=…)` turns an
    unmatched frontier role into an on-demand spawn (default seam: the registry's
    `ensure_task → provision_agent → CreateAgentRuntime`; an injected `create_fn` lets tests use a
    fake with no AWS), then re-proposes so a now-standing agent binds. A failed/unconfirmed spawn
    leaves the node held (safe degradation); spawns are surfaced on the cockpit and happen between
    rounds (never a live-plan mutation). Default `auto_create=False`.
  - **Cross-domain precedent transfer** — a built-in deterministic, dependency-free
    `make_hashing_embed_fn()` makes the `PrecedentRetriever` dense rung usable (an injected semantic
    embedder can retrieve a lexically-disjoint related precedent where the lexical rung misses),
    enabling warm-starting a new domain from adjacent experience. Default `embed_fn=None` keeps the
    dense rung off.

- **`GovernorLoop(checkpoint_every=N)` — opt-in auto-checkpoint cadence.** Realizes the C-4
  checkpoint-compaction win *automatically*: every `N` completed rounds the loop calls
  `store.checkpoint()` so a long-running / standing loop's append-only log stays bounded for warm
  resume (O(events-since-checkpoint), not O(whole log)) without the caller having to remember to
  checkpoint. Default `0` disables it (behavior byte-for-byte unchanged); a store without a
  `checkpoint()` method (the in-process default) silently no-ops; a checkpoint is a derived,
  append-only compaction of the same log (never a mutation/deletion), and a failed compaction is
  swallowed so it can never break a live episode (the loop degrades to a full-log warm resume,
  which is always correct).

- **`MemoryStateStore` checkpoint-compaction warm resume (opt-in).** A new `checkpoint()` writes one
  append-only `CHECKPOINT` event carrying the compacted latest-per-node snapshot of the current
  *epoch*, then rotates the epoch forward. A later `replay()` detects the latest checkpoint (via a
  bounded `record_type=checkpoint` `EQUALS_TO` query), re-hydrates from its snapshot, and folds only
  the open-epoch tail (a bounded `epoch=<n>` `EQUALS_TO` query) — so warm resume reads
  **O(events-since-the-last-checkpoint)** instead of the whole session log (it lets a standing
  KTLO-style loop scale). The append-only log stays the single source of truth — a checkpoint is a
  *derived* snapshot, never deletes raw events, and any missing/undecodable snapshot (or
  `replay(force_full=True)`) transparently falls back to the original full cold rebuild, which is
  provably identical. With no checkpoint ever written the resume path is byte-for-byte unchanged.
  This is the wire-supported form of the previously-rejected O(new) "watermark" resume: AgentCore
  `ListEvents` has no range filter (only `EQUALS_TO | EXISTS | NOT_EXISTS`) and `nextToken` is an
  opaque pagination cursor, so bounding is expressed with a discrete `epoch` equality tag, not a
  `> watermark` range.

### Changed

- **`deliberate.seed()` now REUSES a strong retrieved precedent instead of appending it
  (prune-and-replace).** When the retriever returns a precedent scoring at/above `reuse_threshold`
  that carries a decomposition, the goal root is seeded **pre-decomposed** — the prior's steps
  become confident children that `open_frontier` immediately excludes — so warm plan-formation is
  **cheaper than cold** (the flywheel actually compounds). Previously `seed()` *appended* the
  precedent as an extra sibling root, which made a warm start cost *more* than a cold one. The
  cold / weak-precedent / no-retriever path is byte-for-byte unchanged (a single `Approach:` root
  at confidence 0.0). Measured over the OPC flywheel eval (5 families × 6 marketplaces): warm-reuse
  drops from cold's 7.0 investigator calls to **0.0** once a same-family precedent exists (was
  **+1 vs cold** before the fix) — with the *same* plain investigator, because reuse is now
  structural at seed time rather than contingent on an exploiting investigator. Closes the one open
  loop of the OPC gap review (FZ 35e8 / 35e8a).

### Added

- **`governor/` — the dynamic OUTER control loop that drives the shipped freeze compiler as
  bounded episodes (opt-in, LangGraph-free by default).** concursus proper stays a COMPILER:
  `assemble()`/`recompile()` turn a DAG + manifests into a frozen `ProvisioningPlan` VALUE and
  `Supervisor.run` executes it in a single static forward pass. The new `governor` subpackage adds
  a strictly-outer layer that runs a *bounded cycle around* that compiler — a **dynamic outer loop
  hosting freeze inner episodes**: each round forms a FRESH frozen plan at the compiler front and
  dispatches ONE new bounded episode. It never reaches inside a running `Supervisor`, never mutates
  a frozen plan, and never turns the compiler into a runtime governor (identity invariants
  INV-1..INV-5). **Entirely opt-in** — the zero-config path stays static `assemble` ->
  `Supervisor.run`; you reach for the governor only when you want the cyclic driver. Modules:
  - **`state.GovernorState`** (G-1) — persistent outer-loop state that holds the SEQUENCE of frozen
    plan VALUEs by `plan_version` plus a POINTER to the append-only `StateStore` log (the sole
    structural anchor of the executed prefix), never a mutable compiler plan. `advance` bumps the
    version by swapping in a new plan formed at the compiler front; prior plan values stay
    byte-identical. No `set_output`-style in-place edit exists (INV-3/INV-4/INV-5).
  - **`loop.GovernorLoop`** (G-2/G-3/C-1/C-2/G-4) — the FIXED cyclic control loop, compiled once:
    `planner -> router -> run_episode -> collect -> route_after_collect -> {planner | router |
    synthesize} -> END`. `planner` forms a new frozen plan (first round `plan_from_goal` +
    `assemble`, later rounds `recompile` — a fresh, monotonic, revision-bumped VALUE); `run_episode`
    calls `Supervisor.run` ONCE to completion (one static pass, INV-1); `collect` folds the episode
    outputs into the append-only log and re-derives the executed prefix from `store.completed()`
    each round (never a mutable cache). Bounded four ways so it MUST terminate
    (frontier-exhaustion / `no_progress_n` stall / `max_rounds` budget / a hard structural
    `step_cap`). Mirrors the `DKSEngine` cyclic-driver template: LangGraph is an **optional** backend
    imported LAZILY inside `_build_langgraph` (`backend="auto"|"python"|"langgraph"`), and the SAME
    node functions + routing run via a pure-Python driver when it is absent — so `import concursus`
    and the tests run with **no langgraph installed**. **C-1** re-declares the freeze boundary from
    the log each round; **C-2** is the durable-store selection behind the `StateStore` Protocol seam
    (in-process default, or a `MemoryStateStore` for durable dual resume — an outer `plan_version`
    checkpoint + inner log replay). Exposes `GovernorResult`, `GovernorLoopError`, `GOV_NODES`, and
    a `CheckpointStore` / `InProcessCheckpointStore`.
  - **`scheduler.TrustLadderScheduler`** (S10-G6) — the `router` node's per-decision matcher. At
    dispatch it matches each ready frontier step to a *standing* agent (via the read-only
    `AgentRegistry`), reads that agent's *earned* trust off a GOV-side trust ladder, and returns a
    `FrontierProposal` VALUE of the steps cleared to compile next (`DISPATCH`), those below-bar and
    **escalated** L1->L3 (`ESCALATE`), and those with no serving agent (`UNMATCHED`). The proposal is
    INPUT to the NEXT `recompile` — the scheduler never mutates a frozen plan, never calls
    `assemble`/`recompile` itself, and never reaches into a running Supervisor (INV-3/INV-4).
    `update_trust` — the ONLY place trust is (re)earned — is GOV-side only; `evaluate_deploy_gate`
    remains the create-time seed the ladder READS once per agent, never per invocation (INV-5).
  - **`registry.AgentRegistry`** (S9-G7) — the governor's **process table**, a read-only derived
    view over the shipped `DeployLedger` that answers the dispatch-time question the ledger
    deliberately does not (*"which standing agent, at which version, can do task X?"*). It groups
    `ledger.rows()` into one current-version row per agent name (`AgentVersion`, newest fingerprint
    wins, mirroring `DeployLedger.lookup`), matches a task to the current version whose declared
    capabilities cover it, and offers on-demand spawn/fork by delegating to the shipped
    `provision_agent` actuator (never a new deploy path). Capability metadata is registry-side and
    never written back into the content-identity-only ledger; the registry is a rebuildable
    projection (INV-5).
  - **`cockpit.DirectorCockpit`** (S6-G5) — a read-only director view v0 that composes three
    surfaces out of already-shipped read models: a **briefing** (`render_precedent_hub` +
    `Supervisor.summary`), an **exception queue** (`RunIndex.query(status="failed")` +
    `summary().failed`), and a **runs monitor** (`RunIndex` metadata + plan-version / progress). It
    SELECTS nothing, SEEDS nothing, SCHEDULES nothing, and re-derives every view from the
    append-only log on each call (INV-5).
  - **`ktlo.KTLODaemon`** (S11-G8) — a standing "keep-the-lights-on" monitor *above* the loop that
    wraps `monitor -> triage -> escalate -> (replan | close)` over a live `EventSource`: it wakes on
    event arrival + drift, triages each signal (`TRIAGE_CLOSE` / `TRIAGE_INVESTIGATE` /
    `TRIAGE_ESCALATE`), and per triggered investigation dispatches ONE fresh bounded `GovernorLoop`
    episode over a fresh store. `LAUNCH` (one-shot drain) vs `KTLO` (standing cyclic, bounded by a
    hard `max_ticks`) is a CONFIG on the same machinery, not two code paths. The daemon only
    ENQUEUES episodes; it never reaches inside a running `Supervisor` and holds no mutable plan — N
    events => N independent, bounded, replayable-in-isolation episodes; a failing episode is recorded
    and the daemon survives (INV-1/INV-4). Ships an `InProcessEventQueue` / `ScriptedEventSource`.
  - **`scope`** (S12-G9) — the program/portfolio layer *above* the single-run unit: an
    `org -> portfolio -> program -> task` `ScopeAddress` stack, a `build_programs_index` /
    `render_programs_index` cross-program memory synthesis at PROGRAM grain (the program-grain
    analogue of the runs-grain precedent hub), and a 1:N `director_leverage_view` (one director over
    many programs, each hosting many KTLO episodes). Pure GOV aggregation over READ MODELS — a
    read-only projection over the per-run precedent notes loaded via `load_precedents`; it calls no
    `assemble()`/`recompile()`/`Supervisor.run()`/`StateStore.put()`, drives no dispatch, and
    regenerates byte-identically from the notes each call (INV-5).
- **Phase-5 integration — the governor loop is now WIRED to the shipped governance machinery
  (opt-in, default path byte-for-byte unchanged).** The previous bullet added `GovernorLoop`,
  `TrustLadderScheduler`, `DirectorCockpit`, and `scope` as modules; this wires them into the fixed
  `planner -> router -> run_episode -> collect` cycle behind opt-in seams, so the zero-config loop
  (no `scheduler=`, `deliberate=False`) stays exactly today's behavior and all 357 pre-existing
  tests are unchanged.
  - **I-0 pre-freeze deliberation in `planner` (`deliberate=True`)** — round-1 DAG authoring can now
    run the bounded `reasoning.deliberate.form_plan` SEED -> read-frontier -> dispatch -> digest ->
    verdict -> re-read loop, which ADJUSTS the plan and only lowers to a frozen `AgentDAG` AFTER the
    debate converges (SIGNOFF), then hands it to `assemble` exactly as before. Dynamic but STRICTLY
    before `assemble` and terminating in a frozen DAG (INV-1..INV-4); later rounds still use
    `recompile`. Default `deliberate=False` is byte-for-byte the single-shot `plan_from_goal` path.
    Injected seams (`trail_factory` / `investigator` / `deliberate_retriever`) default to
    deterministic stubs, so it runs with neither langgraph nor any LLM. Resume re-authors from a
    FRESH empty `HypothesisTrail` so node ids reproduce round-1's exactly (no `MonotonicityError`).
  - **I-1 `router` gates the frontier by EARNED trust (`scheduler=`)** — when a `TrustLadderScheduler`
    is injected, `router` calls `propose_frontier(plan, completed=store.completed())` each round and
    partitions the still-open frontier into cleared (`DISPATCH`) vs HELD (`ESCALATE` below-bar /
    `UNMATCHED` no standing agent). Held nodes are handed to the Supervisor's new opt-in `held` skip
    param — a pure NON-DISPATCH (never invoked, nothing written to the log, no failed record / no
    spurious replan) — so the frozen `plan.order` is NEVER mutated (INV-3; holding by non-dispatch,
    not by shrinking the plan, so `recompile` never raises `MonotonicityError`). Held nodes stay in
    the open frontier for a later round once their trust is re-earned, and are surfaced on the new
    `GovernorResult.escalated` / `unmatched` governance surfaces the cockpit exception queue can read.
  - **I-2 `collect` re-earns trust GOV-side** — with a scheduler wired, every node that FIRST
    completes a round re-earns its earned grade via `TrustLadderScheduler.update_trust`, keyed on the
    episode outcome. This is the ONLY place earned trust moves across episodes; it lives in `collect`,
    NEVER in the compiler, and never calls the create-time `evaluate_deploy_gate` per invocation
    (INV-5). Re-earn is keyed by the matched AGENT NAME (resolved from the round's `FrontierProposal`
    decisions), not the task label, and each node re-earns exactly ONCE — the round it finishes
    (anchored on the prior round's completed set, so resume never re-earns a surviving prefix).
  - **I-3 read-only live cockpit / scope over the running loop** — `GovernorLoop.cockpit()`,
    `.programs_index(vault)`, and `.leverage_view(vault)` expose the shipped `DirectorCockpit` and
    `scope` projections over the loop's OWN append-only log and final frozen plan VALUE. Pure read
    surfaces (INV-5): they build a `Supervisor` only to call its shipped read models, never call
    `run`, never assemble/recompile, never dispatch, and never `put` — rendering leaves the store
    byte-identical.
- **Phase-5.5 governed-KTLO wiring — the standing daemon now spawns GOVERNED episodes and the
  director cockpit surfaces the governance holds (opt-in, default path byte-for-byte unchanged).**
  Phase-5 wired the scheduler/deliberation seams INTO a single `GovernorLoop`; Phase-5.5 threads
  those same seams THROUGH the `KTLODaemon` (the standing monitor above the loop) and out to the
  `DirectorCockpit`, so a keep-the-lights-on investigation can be trust-gated and a held frontier is
  visible to the operator. With no new args the daemon still enqueues plain bounded episodes exactly
  as today — all pre-existing tests are unchanged (INV-1/INV-4: each episode stays a fresh
  frozen-plan bounded loop).
  - **J-1 `KTLODaemon` forwards `scheduler=`/`deliberate=` into each spawned episode** — the daemon
    gains opt-in `scheduler=`/`deliberate=` params that `_build_loop` forwards into the fresh
    `GovernorLoop` it enqueues per triggered investigation, so a standing daemon can dispatch
    GOVERNED episodes (earned-trust frontier gating + pre-freeze deliberation). Default
    `scheduler=None`/`deliberate=False` is byte-for-byte the plain episode the daemon builds today;
    the daemon still only ENQUEUES fresh bounded loops over fresh stores and holds no mutable plan.
  - **J-2 the cockpit exception queue surfaces trust escalations + unmatched-agent stalls** — the
    loop now retains the last episode's `escalated` / `unmatched` governance surfaces and passes them
    through `GovernorLoop.cockpit()`, and `DirectorCockpit.exception_queue()` folds them in alongside
    the failed-node rows — so below-bar `ESCALATE` holds and no-standing-agent `UNMATCHED` holds are
    now operator-visible, not just failures. Still a pure read model (INV-5): it re-derives every row
    from the append-only log and the final frozen plan VALUE, dispatching / seeding / scheduling
    nothing.
  - **J-3 an unmatched-node stall is labeled `unmatched_stall`** — when the loop can make no further
    progress solely because every remaining open-frontier node is UNMATCHED (no standing agent can
    serve it), `GovernorResult.terminated_by` now reports the distinct `unmatched_stall` label rather
    than a generic `no_progress` / `frontier_exhaust`, so the terminal condition names the actual
    cause. Only reachable with a `scheduler=` wired; the ungoverned loop's termination labels are
    unchanged.
- **C-3 core seams (identity-preserving, wiring shipped machinery into the dispatch path)** —
  - **C-3a `Supervisor` pre-dispatch structural gate** — the constructor now projects the frozen
    plan (`plan.order` nodes + `plan.wiring` `AgentRef` edges) into a `RunGraph` and runs the
    already-shipped `RunGraph.validate()` ONCE, rejecting a dangling `AgentRef` (a wire naming a
    producer absent from `plan.order`) or a cycle **before the first invoke** (raising
    `RunGraphError`) — the structural complement to the per-output `validate_output` shape check.
    Evaluated once at construction; `run()` stays an untouched single static forward pass (INV-1),
    closing the gap that `RunGraph.validate` shipped but was never called in the dispatch path.
  - **C-3b `MemoryStateStore.replay()` documented as a full cold rebuild** — `replay()` remains a
    full end-to-end re-read of the session log (caches REPLACED, never appended) with an inline
    rationale for why an O(new) watermark is NOT wire-supported: AgentCore's `nextToken` is an
    opaque pagination cursor, not an "events-after-eventId" filter, so an incremental replay would
    either re-read + duplicate the retained prefix or silently drop a concurrent writer's
    earlier-ordered event. The full rebuild is the only path that stays identical to the durable log
    on every call — exactly the INV-5 discipline the governor relies on (re-derive the executed
    prefix from the append-only log each round, never from a mutably-cached suffix).
- **Public API** — `GovernorState`, `GovernorLoop`, `GovernorLoopError`, `GovernorResult`,
  `CheckpointStore`, `InProcessCheckpointStore`, `GOV_NODES`, `TrustLadderScheduler`,

  `programs_dir`, and `director_leverage_view` are now exported from `concursus`.
- **Reasoning-substrate tier (Phase 5, opt-in, LLM/LangGraph-free by default)** — the plan is
  FORMED by bounded deliberation strictly BEFORE `assemble`, then LOWERED to a frozen `AgentDAG`;
  `Supervisor.run` is untouched. Every model/agent seam is injected with deterministic-stub
  defaults, so `import concursus` and the full test suite run with **neither langgraph nor any LLM**
  installed (a new optional `reasoning` extra pins langgraph for the accelerated backend).
  - **`trailstore.HypothesisTrail`** (AI-23/26) — the durable `.3` hypothesis-branch API:
    `fanout_root_hypotheses` / `fanout_hypotheses` / `open_frontier(depth_cap, confidence_floor)` /
    `write_verdict` (append VERDICT + flip RESOLVED atomically) / `hypotheses`, plus a Dung
    grounded-semantics layer (`attack`, `compute_grounded_extension` -> IN/OUT/UNDEC, `arg_label`)
    and a `require_resolved` / `ThreadNotResolved` convergence guard.
  - **`dks_engine.DKSEngine`** (AI-24/27/32) — a BOUNDED cyclic deliberation state machine
    (observe -> … -> re-observe) carrying MDP-ish state `s_t=(n,r,c,f)`; LangGraph backend when
    available, else a pure-Python fallback driver running the same nodes/routing. `route_by_confidence`
    + CCS scoring (>=0.85 auto / 0.50–0.85 argue / <0.50 escalate) with injected `policy=` (RL seam)
    and `counter_argument_fn=` (MOOG seam). Bounded by `max_rounds`/`depth_cap`/`confidence_floor`.
  - **`inner_graph`** (AI-25/29) — `partition_frontier` / `compile_inner_graph` / `dispatch_frontier`
    run one investigator per open hypothesis (a fresh disposable per-round projection, clamped to a
    concurrency ceiling, merged order-insensitively; a worker failure is `InvestigationResult(ok=False)`,
    never an exception) with `InnerGraphDigest` write-back to the `.2` worker-log lane (idempotent
    on a dedup key) — never writing `.3` verdicts.
  - **`deliberate`** (AI-28/30/31) — `seed(goal, retriever=)` (goal-triggered episode, precedent
    priming), `lower_to_dag(root, require_resolved=)` (a pure deterministic fold of the IN-labelled
    hypotheses into an immutable `AgentDAG` the existing assembler freezes; raises on an open
    frontier), and `form_plan(...)` — the bounded SEED -> READ -> DISPATCH -> DIGEST -> VERDICT ->
    RE-READ driver that terminates in a frozen plan and hands it to the compiler.
- **Adaptive-compiler tier (opt-in, identity-preserving)** — the plan-generation feedback edge is
  now expressible AROUND the compiler without ever entering `Supervisor.run`:
  - **AI-22 `planner.plan_from_goal(goal, *, precedents=, operator_directives=, plan_model_fn=)`** —
    the generative FRONT of the compiler (emit -> validate -> freeze -> replay). It authors an
    `AgentDAG` that `OrchestrationAssembler.assemble` then validates + freezes + lowers; it
    dispatches nothing and emits no plan mid-run. The LLM is an **injected, optional**
    `plan_model_fn` seam — default `None` falls back to a trivial DETERMINISTIC template, so
    importing/using concursus needs **no** model. Retrieved precedents (AI-17) + operator
    directives are read-only context to the seam.
  - **AI-20 `OrchestrationAssembler.recompile(prior_plan, *, completed, content_hashes=, dag=,
    manifests=, max_revisions=)`** — the ONLY sanctioned plan mutation: a **bounded, monotonic**
    re-compile that emits a FRESH FROZEN SUPERSET plan **pinning** already-executed nodes
    (`completed()`/`content_hash`) to their prior entry/wiring, with a `_check_monotonic` guard
    that RAISES `MonotonicityError` on any edit/removal/reorder of an executed (or already-planned)
    node, and a `max_revisions` cap. A `ProvisioningPlan.revision` field (default `0`, surfaced in
    `to_dict()` only when non-zero) tracks the re-compile count. The prior/running plan is never
    mutated; resume-as-replay survives.
  - **AI-21 `concursus run --approve/--plan-approval` (+ `--yes`)** — an opt-in between-phases gate
    that previews the FROZEN `ProvisioningPlan.to_dict()` and PAUSES for confirmation BEFORE any
    billed `InvokeAgentRuntime` (safe precisely because the plan is frozen). Interactive by
    default; a non-TTY requires `--yes` or aborts. **Off by default** — today's `run --execute`
    path is byte-for-byte unchanged.
  - **AI-19 `docs/agentcore_placement.md`** — a design note (no runtime code, no boto3) for
    AgentCore-aligned durable placement: AgentCore Memory as the canonical append-only log + a
    derived on-disk `FileVault` vault (notes + `rundb`) on a BYO EFS mount via
    `filesystemConfigurations`, kept EXTERNAL/opt-in behind the `StateStore` seam, plus the
    session-scoped-writes / `VPC`+2049 / `HealthyBusy` / EFS-advisory-lock alignment checklist.
- **Deterministic `MemoryStateStore` ordering** — a store-local strict-monotonic sequence
  (`Record.seq`, mirroring `InProcessStateStore._clock`) is now the primary tie-break in
  `_is_newer`, replacing reliance on the ambiguous AgentCore `eventTimestamp` (kept for display).
  Concurrent branch/retry writes resolve deterministically on replay.
- **`RunIndex.validate()`** — an opt-in structural layout guard (`RunIndexError`) asserting the
  honest-tree invariants over the materialized-path addresses (every non-root address's
  parent-prefix is a real record; every root segment names a known node; optional contiguous
  attempts). Never mutates or re-addresses.
- **Incremental run DB + optional FTS** — `build_run_db(run_dir, incremental=True)` (default) now
  re-ingests only notes whose `st_mtime` changed (mtime/`content_hash`-keyed, mirroring the
  vault's `build_unified_db` discipline), drops rows for vanished notes, and rebuilds only the
  derived read-models — byte-for-byte identical to a full rebuild (`incremental=False`). An
  optional `records_fts` FTS5 table indexes run outputs for full-text search, degrading gracefully
  when the SQLite build lacks FTS5. Still a derived, gitignored, disposable projection.
- **ARN binding-integrity assertion (opt-in)** — `Supervisor(arn_resolver=…)` verifies, just
  before invoke, that a node's compiled ARN is provisioned (not the `<agent-runtime-arn>`
  placeholder) and — when a resolver is supplied — matches the authoritative ARN; a mismatch
  fails/records ("re-compile") rather than **silently rebinding** a frozen binding. It is an
  integrity *assertion*, never a runtime rebind and never a dispatch-time agent chooser.
- **Deploy governance (opt-in)** — `provision_plan(halt_on_error=…)` always returns partial
  results with a `failed` verb so one bad node no longer discards an in-progress deploy; a new
  `trust.py` (`TrustGrade`, pure `evaluate_deploy_gate`) + three declarative `AgentManifest` fields
  (`trust_seed` / `side_effecting` / `escalate_boundary`) add a **create-time** live|shadow|hold
  gate that fires once per deploy (never per-invocation, never earns/updates trust, never selects
  among agents); and a new `ledger.py` (`DeployLedger`) is a persistence-only, fingerprint-keyed,
  atomically-written deploy history enabling reuse-by-content across CLI invocations. New
  `deploy --min-autonomy/--require-approval` CLI flags. All defaults preserve today's deploy path.
- **Failure-tolerant `Supervisor` (opt-in)** — `Supervisor(on_error='record', max_attempts=N)`
  turns the static topo executor into a *fault-tolerant* one **without making it dynamic**: a
  failed node is recorded (`status='failed'`) and the run continues, transitively-blocked
  downstream nodes are skipped with a `blocked_on` reason, and `run()` returns the partial
  `{node: output}` of everything that completed. Bounded retry re-invokes the **same**
  manifest-pinned node id up to `max_attempts` (never branches/replans the topology). A new
  read-only `summary()` / `summary_line()` folds the partial outcome purely from the store, and
  the CLI prints it on failure. **Defaults are byte-for-byte fail-fast** (`on_error='raise'`,
  `max_attempts=1`) — the tested schema-error contract is unchanged.
- **Typed, self-validating `Record` fields** — `RecordStatus` / `RecordType` (`str`-subclass
  enums) + `Record.__post_init__` + `StateStoreError`: an unknown `status` now fails loudly at
  construction instead of silently dropping a node from `completed()`; unknown `record_type`
  widens-and-warns. Str-subclass enums keep every `== 'validated'` comparison and the on-disk
  form byte-identical.
- **Reentrant-lock guard** on `InProcessStateStore` / `MemoryStateStore` (`threading.RLock`
  around read-then-write bodies) so a future concurrent-dispatch supervisor cannot lose-update
  internal state. RLock only — the in-memory stores don't take on `FileVaultStateStore`'s
  fcntl+OCC.
- **Content fingerprint + reuse-by-content on deploy** — `build.fingerprint(manifest)` hashes an
  agent's **hosting identity** (container/protocol/entry/network/role/input-keys/output-schema —
  *not* model/prompt/behavior) with the same sha256-canonical-JSON discipline as
  `content_hash`, stamped onto `BuildPlanEntry.fingerprint`. `provision_agent(..., known_fingerprints=)`
  (opt-in) then reports `action='reused'` on a matching fingerprint and `'updated'` on a changed
  one — deploy dedup + real-change detection, never a dispatch-time version chooser.
- **`distill` — post-run precedent notes + a cross-run hub** — `distill.distill_run(store)` folds
  a finished run's `{node: output}` + recorded `consumes` graph + outcome into one compact
  precedent note under `<vault>/precedents/` (a sibling of `runs/`, deliberately isolated so a
  precedent is never reloaded as a run record). `distill.render_precedent_hub` is a pure,
  idempotent `entry_folgezettel_trails`-style projection over the set of precedent notes (one row
  per run), with a `runindex.PrecedentIndex` cross-run query surface and a disposable
  `rundb.build_precedent_db`. All read-only / post-run — the compiler identity is untouched.
- **`concursus run --vault --lean-form`** — the on-disk `StateStore` emits authentic
  Abuse-SlipBox notes by default (`slipbox_form=True` — indexer-ingestible, with a `_run.md`
  entry point); the new **`--lean-form`** CLI flag (or `slipbox_form=False`) opts into the lean
  machine schema (`node`/`attempt`/`status`/`consumes`/`payload`) for a smaller, non-indexed
  round-trip-exact durable log.
- **`FileVaultStateStore`** — a persistent, on-disk `StateStore` backend (no AWS), closing the
  gap that the in-memory `InProcessStateStore` (state lost on exit) and the opaque-Blob
  `MemoryStateStore` left open. Each record is written as a **round-trip-exact markdown note**
  under `<vault>/runs/<session>/`: two authoritative embedded base64 JSON blobs (`meta` + the
  output `payload`) are the source of truth (arbitrary outputs — newlines, quotes, `---`, link
  syntax, numeric-looking strings — survive exactly), while everything else is a greppable display
  copy never re-ingested. **Notes conform to the Abuse SlipBox format** by default
  (`slipbox_form=True`) — P.A.R.A. `tags` / `keywords` / `topics` / a **derived** `building_block`
  (validated→`empirical_observation`, failed→`counter_argument`, dedup→`navigation`) / valid
  `status` / `folgezettel` + `lineage` (a per-run Folgezettel trail rooted at `1`, records as
  write-order children `1a`, `1b`, …) / `access_control_group`, a typed H1, and a `## Related
  Notes` section (run entry + `consumes` producers) — so they validate under `check_note_format.py`
  and read as a genuine, indexer-ingestible slipbox trail (a `_run.md` entry point roots the trail
  so no note is an orphan). Pass `slipbox_form=False` for the lean machine schema.
  It **reuses the existing marshalling seam** (`_build_metadata` / `_event_to_record` /
  `content_hash` / `_index_records`), so it shares `MemoryStateStore`'s Record↔dict contract and
  differs only in transport. Writes are atomic (temp + `os.replace`); a reentrant lock plus a
  generation-token OCC over `.lock` / `.gen` sidecars serialize concurrent writers over one vault.
  **Resume = reload**: a fresh store over an existing vault reconstructs `completed()` / `get()`.
  `FileVaultStateStore.from_config(vault_path=, session_id=)` is the persistence-by-default
  constructor; the bare `InProcessStateStore` remains the ephemeral default.
- **`rundb.build_run_db`** — a **derived, rebuildable SQLite** graph/index over a persisted run's
  notes, mirroring the slipbox's `build_unified_db` discipline: a `records` metadata-postings
  table (indexed on node/status/record_type/schema/producer), a `consumes_edges` data-dependency
  table (the `AgentRef` graph at rest), a `run_addresses` execution-tree table, and a
  `projection` VIEW (latest validated per node). Reads **only** the notes (the single source of
  truth); the DB is gitignored and disposable — deleting it loses nothing.
- **CLI** — `concursus run --vault <dir> --execute` persists the run to the on-disk vault and
  builds its derived run DB; exposes `FileVaultStateStore` and `build_run_db` from the package
  root.

### Notes

- The on-disk notes stay the single source of truth; `RunGraph` / `RunIndex` remain the fast
  in-process derived structures, and the SQLite DB is the queryable-at-rest mirror. This is the
  offline / air-gapped / CI / debuggable durability tier (FZ 35e1b1); for AgentCore-hosted runs a
  BYO EFS/S3 Files mount or the managed Memory log remain the aligned choices (FZ 35e1b2).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- **`statestore`** — a `StateStore` seam for durable, addressable run state (the slipbox's
  single-source-of-truth log + derived-projection discipline). Two backends share one Protocol:
  `InProcessStateStore` (the zero-dependency, offline default — an append-only `Record` log plus a
  `{node: latest validated output}` projection, with per-node attempt auto-increment and
  `content_hash` no-op dedup) and `MemoryStateStore` (opt-in, AgentCore Memory-backed — one Blob
  event per validated output plus typed metadata; **replay-resume** rebuilds the projection from
  the event log via paginated `list_events`, so a run survives micro-VM teardown). boto3 is
  imported lazily only in the Memory backend; every test injects a fake client (no AWS). Exposes
  `StateStore` / `InProcessStateStore` / `MemoryStateStore` / `Record` / `content_hash`.
- **`rungraph`** — the AgentRef link graph: each `Record` persists its resolved `consumes` edges
  (`"producer:$.path"`), so the log projects into a queryable `RunGraph` (`from_records` /
  `from_edges`) with transitive `upstream`/`downstream`, a structural `validate` (raises
  `RunGraphError` on a cycle or a dangling AgentRef), and a bounded nearest-first `context_order`.
  Pure Python — no networkx.
- **`runindex`** — a dual index over the run log, exposing BOTH ways to read state: a **metadata
  query** surface (inverted postings over `node`/`status`/`record_type`/`schema`/`producer` —
  `query(status="failed")` is a lookup, not a payload scan, the local analogue of `list_events`
  filters) and a **Folgezettel-tree traversal** over each `Record`'s new materialized-path
  `address` (default the node name; a retry/fan-out/branch appends a `/` segment). The parent is
  prefix-derivable, so `ancestors`/`descendants`/`children`/`siblings`/`traverse` reconstruct the
  execution tree — the run-state analogue of `slipbox-traverse-folgezettel`. A sub-address maps to
  an AgentCore `branch{name, rootEventId}` in `MemoryStateStore`, so retries/fan-outs land as
  branches in the Memory log. `Supervisor.index()` returns it. Pure Python.
- **`Supervisor`** — now threads outputs through the `StateStore` seam (new `state_store=` keyword,
  defaulting to `InProcessStateStore`): a node already in `completed()` is skipped (resume), and
  each validated output is `put` with its `producer` / `consumes` / `schema` metadata. New
  `Supervisor.context(node)` returns the transitive upstream outputs (`{producer: output}`) via the
  run graph — shared upstream state as a query, not point-to-point wiring.
- **CLI** — `run --memory-id ID [--actor-id ID]` backs a `run --execute` with a durable, resumable
  `MemoryStateStore` sharing the supervisor's `runtimeSessionId` (default actor `run`); boto3 is
  used only under `--execute`, and the dry-run path still imports nothing.
- **Public API** — `StateStore`, `InProcessStateStore`, `MemoryStateStore`, `Record`,
  `content_hash`, `RunGraph`, `RunGraphError`, `RunIndex` are now exported from `concursus`.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- **`provision`** — the deploy-time actuator behind `deploy --execute`: for each agent (in
  topological order) it ensures the IAM execution role (`create_role` + attach policy,
  idempotent), builds and pushes the container image to ECR when the plan carries a placeholder
  URI (`docker login`/`build`/`push` over a non-destructive temp build context), substitutes the
  real `roleArn` + `containerUri` into the request, and calls `CreateAgentRuntime`; an already
  built image or an existing runtime ARN is reused as-is. Every AWS client (`Clients`) and the
  shell runner are injectable, so the orchestration is unit-tested with fakes — no AWS, no Docker.
  Exposed as `provision_plan` / `Clients` / `ProvisionError`.
- **CLI** — `deploy --execute` now runs that full role→image→`CreateAgentRuntime` flow (previously
  it only called `CreateAgentRuntime` with placeholder role/image); new `--source-dir DIR|NODE=DIR`
  (build context, default `.`) and `--tag` (image tag, default `latest`). The dry-run now lists
  the role/image/create steps per agent. boto3 + the `docker` CLI are used only under `--execute`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-07

The offline compiler — `AgentDAG` + manifests now compile into a provisioning plan and a
topological supervisor, all pure-Python (boto3 stays behind the `[agentcore]` extra, imported
lazily only when a verb actually talks to AWS).

### Added

- **`resolve`** — the dependency resolver: `extract` (a minimal JSONPath over invoke
  outputs), `resolve_edges` (compile each manifest's `depends_on` into `AgentRef` wiring),
  and `check_alignment` (type-gate every edge's producer, output field, consumer input, and
  DAG edge; raises `AlignmentError`).
- **`build`** — the runtime builder: `RuntimeBuilderFactory` dispatches a manifest to an
  HTTP/MCP/A2A template (or the `PreBuiltRegistrar` for a prebuilt image / reused runtime ARN)
  and emits a `BuildPlanEntry` — the serving `app.py`, `Dockerfile`, synthesized IAM execution
  role, and `create_agent_runtime` params. `PORTS = {HTTP: 8080, MCP: 8000, A2A: 9000}`.
- **`assemble`** — `OrchestrationAssembler` compiles an `AgentDAG` + manifests into a
  JSON-serializable `ProvisioningPlan` (validate → align → wire → synthesize → order); pure and
  offline.
- **`supervisor`** — `Supervisor` dispatches a plan in topological order, threads each
  producer's output into its dependents via the `AgentRef` wiring, shape-checks results with
  `validate_output` (raises `SchemaError`), and shares one `runtimeSessionId` across the run.
  The invoke transport is injectable; the default binds boto3's `bedrock-agentcore` data plane
  lazily.
- **CLI** — three compiler verbs alongside `info`/`validate`: `plan` (print the provisioning
  plan as indented JSON), `deploy` (dry-run what would be created, or `--execute`
  `CreateAgentRuntime` on the control plane), and `run` (`--inputs` JSON; dry-run the topo
  dispatch, or `--execute` the live `InvokeAgentRuntime` loop). `--dag FROM->TO` overrides the
  edges inferred from `depends_on`.
- **Public API** — `AgentRef`, `AlignmentError`, `resolve_edges`, `check_alignment`,
  `RuntimeBuilderFactory`, `BuildPlanEntry`, `OrchestrationAssembler`, `ProvisioningPlan`,
  `Supervisor`, `SchemaError` are now exported from `concursus`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-07

Initial alpha — the declarative core.

### Added

- **`AgentDAG`** — a pure, backend-agnostic directed acyclic graph of agents/tasks:
  `add_node`/`add_edge`, `get_dependencies`/`get_dependents`, `sources`/`sinks`,
  `topological_sort` (Kahn's, raises on a cycle), `validate`, and `to_dict`/`from_dict`.
- **`AgentManifest`** — the `.agent.yaml` model (registry + contract + spec) with
  `from_yaml`/`from_dict` and `validate` (requires a hosting binding and a mandatory output
  JSON Schema — the dependency resolver's type gate).
- **`concursus` CLI** — `info`, `validate <manifest.yaml>...`, `--version`.
- Packaging: PyPI-ready (`pyproject.toml`, dynamic version from `VERSION`, `src/` layout,
  `py.typed`, `concursus[agentcore]` / `concursus[dev]` extras).
